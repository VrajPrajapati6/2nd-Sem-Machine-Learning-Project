# Machine learning model :

This is my first machie learning model prepared with python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
<br>
Motive of this project is to get hands on experience with dataset. To handle & deal with missing values of dataset.
<br>
Display all unique and missing values. Also applt all statistics operations on data. Also visiual representation of it.
<br>
Purpose of this machine learning model is to do classification with help of "K-nearest neighbor classifier". Also provide the accuracy to do it.
