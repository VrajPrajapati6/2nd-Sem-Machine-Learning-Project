# Machine learning model :

This is my first machine learning model prepared with Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
<br>
Motive of this project is to get hands on experience with dataset and to handle & deal with missing values of dataset.
<br>
Display all unique and missing values. Also apply all statistics operations on data so it provide all the statistical values. Also provide visiual representation of data for given dataset.
<br>
Purpose of this machine learning model is to do classification with help of "K-nearest neighbor classifier". Also this ML mode; provide the accuracy to do classification.
